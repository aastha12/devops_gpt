REASONING:
1. **Patterns in similar incidents:** The similar incidents show a recurring theme of authentication issues, particularly related to expired or invalid tokens used for accessing Git repositories. Several incidents specifically mention expired tokens causing pipeline failures and blocking deployments. Another incident mentions a disconnected runner.
2. **Common themes/root causes:** The primary root cause across multiple incidents is the expiration or misconfiguration of access tokens used by automated processes (like CI/CD pipelines) to interact with Git repositories. A secondary cause is runner availability.
3. **Relation to the new incident:** The new incident's error message ("fatal: unable to access 'https://gitlab.com/project/repo.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403") strongly suggests an authentication failure, aligning with the expired token pattern observed in the similar incidents. The fact that it was working yesterday suggests a recent change or expiry.
4. **Troubleshooting approach:** The most logical first step is to investigate the credentials used by the Jenkins pipeline to access the Git repository. This involves checking for expired tokens, incorrect credentials, or permission issues. If tokens are used, verify their validity and scope. Also, check the status of the runners.

REASONING:
1. **Patterns in similar incidents:** The similar incidents show a variety of web service issues, including 500 errors, increased error rates, apdex dips, and performance degradation. The root causes range from database load balancing issues, Redis client connection problems, deployments with slow YAML loading, and potential Gitaly issues. Several incidents self-resolved or were resolved by rollbacks.

2. **Common themes/root causes:** The common themes are performance degradation, increased error rates, and impact on user experience (slow page loads, timeouts). The root causes often involve database issues, Redis issues, deployments, and Gitaly problems. There's a recurring theme of infrastructure components (Redis, Gitaly) and deployments causing problems.

3. **Relationship to the new incident:** The new incident shares similarities with the previous incidents, particularly the 500 errors and impact on user experience. The database connection pool exhaustion and high CPU usage on the DB server point to a database-related root cause, which aligns with some of the previous incidents. The long-running queries are a key indicator.

4. **Troubleshooting approach:** Given the database connection pool exhaustion, high CPU usage, and long-running queries, the initial focus should be on investigating the database. This involves identifying the specific queries causing the high CPU usage, analyzing their execution plans, and determining if they are related to recent code changes or data changes. We should also check for any recent deployments that might have introduced inefficient queries or increased database load.

REASONING:
1. **Patterns in similar incidents:**
    *   Several incidents involve OOMKilled pods (Zoekt pods in particular).
    *   Some incidents relate to resource limits (CPU, memory, disk space) being exceeded.
    *   Some incidents are triggered by new deployments or code changes.
    *   A few incidents involve fluentd archiver issues.

2.  **Common themes/root causes:**
    *   **Resource constraints:** Insufficient memory or disk space allocated to pods.
    *   **Code changes/new deployments:** New code can introduce memory leaks or increase resource consumption.
    *   **Indexing/background processes:** Resource-intensive background tasks can lead to OOM errors.
    *   **Logging issues:** Fluentd archiver problems can cause disk space saturation.

3.  **Relevance to the new incident:**
    *   The new incident involves OOMKilled API pods, similar to the Zoekt pod crashes.
    *   The "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" error indicates a memory issue within the Java application running in the pod.
    *   The gradual increase in memory usage suggests a memory leak or inefficient memory management.
    *   Normal traffic levels rule out a sudden surge in requests as the primary cause.

4.  **Troubleshooting approach:**
    *   Focus on identifying the cause of the memory leak or inefficient memory usage within the Java application.
    *   Increase memory limits as a temporary mitigation, but address the underlying cause.
    *   Investigate recent code changes or deployments that might have introduced the memory issue.
    *   Monitor memory usage closely after any changes.

REASONING:
1. **Patterns in similar incidents:** The similar incidents show a recurring theme of expiring credentials (SSL certificates and tokens) causing service disruptions. We see SSL certificate expiry, expired QA tokens, and expired project access tokens.
2. **Common themes/root causes:** The common root cause is the failure to properly manage and rotate credentials, leading to authentication and authorization failures, and in the case of SSL certificates, service unavailability. The incidents highlight issues with automation (cert-manager) and manual processes (token rotation).
3. **Relation to the new incident:** The new incident directly aligns with the SSL certificate expiry incidents. The cert-manager, which is supposed to automate certificate renewal, failed, leading to the website becoming inaccessible due to the expired SSL certificate. The "DNS propagation timeout" error suggests a potential issue with the DNS challenge process used by cert-manager to verify domain ownership.
4. **Troubleshooting approach:** Given the immediate impact, the first step is to restore service by manually renewing the certificate or using a previously generated valid certificate. Then, investigate the cert-manager failure, focusing on DNS propagation issues and cert-manager configuration. Finally, implement monitoring and alerting to prevent future certificate expirations.

REASONING:
1. **Patterns in similar incidents:** The similar incidents show a recurring theme of expiring credentials (SSL certificates, tokens) causing service disruptions. Several incidents involve expired tokens blocking deployments or causing QA failures. One incident involves SSL certificate expiry. Another involves load balancer issues.
2. **Common themes/root causes:** The common root cause is the failure to properly manage and rotate credentials, particularly SSL certificates and API tokens. This includes monitoring expiry dates and automating the renewal process.
3. **Relation to the new incident:** The new incident directly aligns with the expired SSL certificate theme. The cert-manager failure points to a problem in the automated renewal process, specifically a DNS propagation timeout during the ACME challenge. This suggests a potential issue with DNS configuration, network connectivity, or the ACME server itself.
4. **Troubleshooting approach:** The primary focus should be on restoring service by manually renewing the SSL certificate or temporarily using a valid certificate. Then, investigate the cert-manager failure, focusing on DNS resolution and network connectivity.

REASONING:
1. **Patterns in similar incidents:** The similar incidents show a recurring theme of authentication issues, particularly related to expired or incorrect tokens used for accessing Git repositories. Several incidents specifically mention expired tokens causing pipeline failures and blocking deployments. Another incident mentions incorrect passwords or the need for tokens.
2. **Common themes/root causes:** The primary root cause across the similar incidents is the failure of Git authentication due to expired or invalid credentials (tokens or passwords). This often impacts CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes. A secondary theme is infrastructure issues (runner availability, VM migrations) but these are less relevant to the current incident.
3. **Relation to the new incident:** The new incident's error message ("fatal: unable to access 'https://gitlab.com/project/repo.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403") strongly suggests a Git authentication failure, aligning with the expired/invalid credential pattern seen in the similar incidents. The fact that the pipeline worked yesterday further points to a recent credential expiry or change.
4. **Troubleshooting approach:** The most logical approach is to investigate the credentials used by the Jenkins pipeline to access the Git repository. This involves checking for expired tokens, incorrect passwords, or any recent changes to authentication mechanisms. Given the impact (blocking all releases), this should be investigated urgently.
